# Linear Regression and Multicollinearity Analysis

Welcome to the Linear Regression and Multicollinearity Analysis repository! This project focuses on implementing linear regression, outlier processing, and identifying multicollinearity in a dataset. Whether you're a data scientist, analyst, or someone interested in regression analysis, this code provides insights into these statistical processes.

## Features

- **Linear Regression:** Implement linear regression models to analyze the relationship between dependent and independent variables.

- **Outlier Processing:** Explore techniques to identify and handle outliers in the dataset, ensuring robust regression analysis.

- **Multicollinearity Analysis:** Identify multicollinearity among independent variables and assess its impact on the regression model.

- **Data Visualization:** Utilize visualizations to understand the relationships, detect outliers, and illustrate multicollinearity.
